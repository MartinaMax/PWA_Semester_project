## About The Project

<p>The Project Management Tool is a web application designed to help users organize and track their projects efficiently. Similar to Trello, the app allows users to create boards with tasks represented as cards. Each board provides a structured workflow with columns for To Do, Doing, and Done, enabling task management.</p>
<p>Features include secure login and sign-up functionality to access the app. Users can create, update, move, and delete task cards, assign start and end dates, and add collaborators to work together on projects.</p>
<p>As for documenting the APIs endpoints a Swagger was implemented.</p>
